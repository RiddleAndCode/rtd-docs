This is going to explain how to perform a key ceremony for 3 persons and a master of ceremony.
We will use 3 steel plates to store the whole mnemonic phrase, guaranteeing confidentiality (no single person will ever see or hold all the mnemonic phrase) as well as full recovery in case a single steel plates is missing.

A single plate stores 24 words, 12 on each side.
Each side has 3 rows, with 4 words in each row.
All plates wil be turned over once and then sealed by the master of ceremony, that will also ensure that no person will turn over the plates unless instructed to do so.

The first person will read 8 words from the signature device and will have to transcribe them to plates A and B.
He will write them in words 1 to 8 (first and second row) then turn both plates over.

The second person will read the following 8 words, and write them in plates A and C, using words 5 to 12 (second and third row).
He will then turn over plate B.

The third person will read the final 8 words from the signature devices and write them in plates B and C, using words 1 to 4 for the first 4 words and 9 to 12 for the second 4 words (first and third row).
At this point the plates can be sealed and separately stored.

Given any two plates, when opening them you will have 3 different sides, plus a fourth one which is a copy of one of the others.
Taking the 3 different sides, you can perform a recovery by using a mnemonic with 
* the 8 words on side that has the first and second row filled up, followed by
* the 8 words on side that has the second and third row filled up, followed by
* the 8 words on side that has the first and third row filled up

When it comes to restoring the mnemonic phrase, to ensure that words have been correctly transcripted into the plates, it will have to be performed twice, so that each plate will be used at least once. As part of the recovery, the 2 identical sides out of the 4 used in each restoration attempt will have to be compared, and the fact that they are identical will have to be ensured.
