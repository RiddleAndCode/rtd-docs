## Complete with APIs

####Summary:

* Digital Asset Management Solution offers extensive API support for the flexible integration of internal and external services that automate, enhance and simplify a range of operations.

The Digital Asset Management Solution provides a rich and easy-to-use set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that support interoperability with other systems to quickly and easily access the core features of the solution as well as a wide range of integration options with existing systems.

The APIs also allow our clients to push audit and reconciliation details to client-based systems and integrate external services for KYT (Know Your Transaction) and AML (Anti Money Laundering) purposes.
