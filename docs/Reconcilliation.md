Reconcilliation

This add-on enables FPB to extent their current asset management solution with an automated reconciliation feature to streamline internal processes. The software package delivers a .csv-file with the following structure:

**Account ID**
**Coin address**
**Coin type**
**Time stamp**
**confirmed Balance** 
**unconfirmed balance** 

It creates periodically new files with the balances.
This file is saved on the Trusted Node itself and can be recovered from there.

How to access the data.csv:

Step 1: Logon the Trusted Node with the provided credentials
Step 2: Navigate to the /home/dam/dam/data/data.csv

Note: the data is appended periodically
