# Token Management Platform
# Compelling use cases

Token-based business models will only flourish if the various players have indisputable identities, remain protected from malicious intrusion, dispose of transactional capabilities and adhere to regulatory frameworks.

RIDDLE&CODE Token Management Platform (TMP) provides solutions for all of these aspects and embraces the full spectrum of use cases. This section describes concrete examples, business models and applications that are enabled by the platform.


## Proof-of-origin business models

### Proving the authenticity of luxury goods
It is estimated that the global luxury market will reach €1.3 trillion (~$1.5 trillion) by 2025, with millennials representing 50% of the total market. However, the rapid expansion comes with the challenge of ensuring that luxury products are produced in a fair and sustainable manner for both manufacturers and consumers.

The luxury sector has waged a battle against counterfeiters for years, spending a fortune on distribution control and legal fees. According to a report by Research and Markets, fraud and identity theft have raised strong consumer distrust while luxury brands lost $30.3 billion (€27 billion) to counterfeited goods through the Internet in 2017. The main challenges within the sector remain:
* QR codes and certificates can be forged and are limited to one-way information transactions.
* RFIDs and holograms cannot eliminate theft and counterfeiting.
* Online registries expose consumers to identity theft and private data hacks.

**Solution proposed**
For this use case, the TMP can assign unique identities for high-value luxury goods and create their respective digital twins on the ledger. This allows brands to:
* Digitise, track and trace the entire lifecycle of a luxury product,
* Create an immutable record of every step in the supply chain,
* Capture specific data points and offer public access to that data.
