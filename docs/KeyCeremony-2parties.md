# Key ceremony instructions for 2 participants and 2 plates

## RIDDLE&CODE’s recommendation on how to perform key ceremony:

Below you’ll find RIDDLE&CODE’s recommendation for performing key ceremony. In this example, the ceremony is performed with  a master of ceremony, 2 participants, and 2 plates.

Please read this document in full before starting the ceremony. Revise it carefully and verify that it complies with your safety practices, compliance procedures/requirements, and operational processes.

RIDDLE&CODE’s recommendation is to do a test key ceremony using pieces of paper instead of actual steel plates. This will allow all participants of the ceremony to become familiar with the whole procedure and remove any doubts.

In case of any unclarities or questions, please contact RIDDLE&CODE (add contact email), before proceeding with the ceremony.

**Equipment necessary for performing key ceremony:**
* White room - a secure location without windows, or with blacked-out windows, where no personal communication or recording devices are allowed.
* All the signature devices
* Trusted Node
* 2 steel plates
* 2 locks, fitting the steel plates
* A set of tweezers to help you with inserting the letters in the steel plates
* A flat screwdriver (or something similar) to help opening the steel plates’ barrier which is locking the letters into place.

During the ceremony we’ll use 2 steel plates to store mnemonic phrase. This way, confidentiality is guaranteed since no single person will ever see or hold the entire mnemonic phrase. Also, in case that one steel plate is missing, mnemonic phrase still can be recovered.

**Mnemonic phrase**
Mnemonic phrase is a secret group of 24 words that store all the information necessary for the recovery of a wallet, and hence, assets. To recreate a wallet and get access to funds, the words from the mnemonic phrase have to follow the correct, already established during the defining of quorum order.

RIDDLE&CODE’s recommendation for storing the mnemonic phrase is:
* No single person should know the whole mnemonic phrase
* Steel plates should be stored in a separate physical locations
* When filling out the steel plates, no person should be able to see other person’s words



**The plates**
Each plate is sealed with a lock. A single plate stores 24 words, 12 on each side. Each side has 3 rows, with 4 words in each row.
All plates should rest on a flat, non-transparent surface so that when open, only one side is readable. When turning a plate on the opposite side, the plate should always be closed.
The side can be marked with a temporary removable sticker so that during the validation of the mnemonic phrase you will know which plate contains which words.
Our recommendation is that everybody participating in the key ceremony become familiar with basic steel plates operations such as: opening, closing, turning them over, inserting the letters, etc.

**Master of ceremony**
The master of ceremony is responsible for handing the plates to each participant, and ensuring that no participant will turn them over unless as part of the procedure.
In case that procedure isn’t being followed correctly, the master of ceremony is obliged to stop it and start anew.
Although orchestrating the whole process, the master of ceremony never sees any of the words.

## Key ceremony instructions:
The master of ceremony begins the procedure in front of all participants.

### First participant:
The master of ceremony is left alone with the first participant.
The master of ceremony opens the plates A and B, which contain no words.
The first participant has to privately read 12 words from the signature device and transcribe them to plates A and B, in words 1 to 12 (the first, second, and the third row).
Then, the first participant closes the plates, marks the sides as ‘ALPHA’, and turns over both plates.
Finally, the first participant covers the signature device display.

### Second participant:
The master of ceremony and the second participant join the first participant, who then leaves.
The master of ceremony clicks on the button once and opens the plates A and B, which contain no words on positions 13 to 24.
Then, the second participant privately removes the display cover, reads the following 12 words.
He writes them down in plates A and B using words 13 to 24 (the first, second, and third row).
After this, the second participant marks the sides as ‘BETA’, and turns over the plates to the master of ceremony.
The plates A and B are completed.

Once the key ceremony is completed, it’s time to perform a full restoration of the devices and verification of the generated addresses.
This is done through a process called mnemonic validation, and it validates that the process was successful and that all steel plates contain correct words.
If mnemonic validation isn’t performed, there is no guarantee that you’ll be able to restore a mnemonic phrase. Without mnemonic validation, you won’t be able to perform restoration from mnemonic phrase.



## Mnemonic validation
Mnemonic validation is performed with the steel plates marked with stickers and by the same master of ceremony and the same (or two different ones) participants.
RIDDLE&CODE's recommendation is to perform mnemonic validation with the same participants.

### Mnemonic validation instructions
In this process, each side of 2 plates is used to restore the signature devices.
The master of ceremony is responsible for handing out the correct plates to each person and ensuring that the same plate’s side is not used twice.
The master of key ceremony should also ensure that none of the participants turn the plates and read the opposite side.
Each of the two participants are assigned with a set of words: 'ALPHA. 'BETA'. Altogether, the 2 plates have each set of words written twice.
The first participant ('ALPHA') privately opens the first corresponding side, inputs the words, and closes the plate.
The second participant, using the word 'BETA', does the same.
At this point, a set of addresses has to be generated and verified against the previous one.
The same operation (recover, addresses deletion, generation and verification) will be performed again by using the set of words written on the 'other' plates’ sides (the ones which have not just been used).
After both addresses are verified, the stickers should be removed.
Finally, the master of ceremony seals the steel plates in the presence of all involved people.

## Mnemonic phrase restoration
If you open a steel plate, you’ll see that it has 2 sides with 12 words each containing the mnemonic phrase as a whole.
