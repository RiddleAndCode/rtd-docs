# Key ceremony instructions for 4 participants and 4 plates

## RIDDLE&CODE’s recommendation on how to perform key ceremony:

Below you’ll find RIDDLE&CODE’s recommendation for performing key ceremony. In this example, the ceremony is performed with a master of ceremony, 4 participants, and 4 plates.

Before we start:
Please read this document in full before starting the ceremony. Revise it carefully and verify that it complies with your safety practices, compliance procedures/requirements, and operational processes.

RIDDLE&CODE’s recommendation is to do a test key ceremony using pieces of paper instead of actual steel plates. This will allow all participants of the ceremony to become familiar with the whole procedure and remove any doubts.

In case of any doubts or questions, please contact RIDDLE&CODE (support@riddleandcode.com), before proceeding with the ceremony.

The key ceremony should be performed in a white room - a secure location without windows, or blacked-out windows, where no personal communication or recording devices are allowed.


**Equipment necessary for performing key ceremony:**
* All the signature devices
* Trusted Node
* 4 steel plates
* 4 locks, fitting the steel plates
* A set of tweezers to help you with inserting the letters in the steel plates
* A flat screwdriver (or something similar) to help opening the steel plates’ barrier which is locking the letters into place.


## Getting started:

**Mnemonic phrase**
Mnemonic phrase is a secret group of 24 words that store all the information necessary for the recovery of a wallet, and hence, assets. To recreate a wallet and get access to funds, the words from the mnemonic phrase have to follow the correct, already established during the quorum defining order.

**The plates**
A single plate stores 24 words, 12 on each side. Each side has 3 rows, with 4 words in each row. Each plate is sealed with a lock.
During the ceremony we’ll use 4 steel plates to store mnemonic phrase. This way, confidentiality is guaranteed since no single person will ever see or hold the entire mnemonic phrase. Also, in case that one steel plate is missing, mnemonic phrase still can be recovered.
All plates should rest on a flat, non-transparent surface so that when open, only one side is readable. When turning a plate on the opposite side, the plate should always be closed.

The side can be marked with a temporary removable sticker so that during the validation of the mnemonic phrase you will know which plate contains which words.
Our recommendation is that everyone participating in the key ceremony become familiar with basic steel plates operations such as: opening, closing, turning them over, inserting the letters, etc.

**Master of ceremony**
The master of ceremony is responsible for handing the plates to each participant, and ensuring that no participant will turn them over unless as part of the procedure.
In case that procedure isn’t being followed correctly, the master of ceremony is obliged to stop it and start anew.
Although orchestrating the whole process, the master of ceremony never sees any of the words.


## RIDDLE&CODE’s recommendation for storing the mnemonic phrase is:
No single person should know the whole mnemonic phrase
Steel plates should be stored in a separate physical locations
When filling out the steel plates, no person should be able to see other person’s words



## Key ceremony instructions
The master of ceremony begins the procedure in front of all participants.

### First participant:
The master of ceremony is left alone with the first participant.
The master of ceremony opens the plates A and B, which contain no words.
The first participant privately reads 6 consecutive words from the signature device and transcribes them to plates A and B, in words 1 to 6 (the first and part of the second row).
Next, the first participant marks the sides as ‘ALPHA’, and turns over both plates.
Then, the first participant covers the signature device display.

### Second participant:
The master of ceremony and the second participant join the first participant, who then leaves.
The master of ceremony clicks on the button and opens the plates B and C, which contain no words.
Then, the second participant privately removes the display cover, reads the next 6 words.
He transcribes them down in plates C and D, in words 7 to 12 (part of the second and the third row).
After this, the second participant marks the sides as ‘BETA’ and turns over both plates.
Finally, the second participant covers the signature device display.

### Third participant:
The master of ceremony and the third participant join the second participant who leaves.
The master of ceremony clicks the button once and opens the plates A and B (the sides that contain no words).
After this, the third participant privately removes the display cover and reads the next 6 words from the signature device.
Then, the third participant transcribes the words in plates A and B, in words 13 to 18 (first and part of the second row).
Third participant then marks the sides as ‘GAMMA’.
These plates are now completed.

### Fourth participant:
The master of ceremony and the fourth participant join the third participant who leaves.
The master of ceremony clicks the button once and opens the plates C and D (the sides that contain no words).
The fourth participant privately removes the display cover and reads the final 6 words from the signature device.
Then, the fourth participant transcribes the words in plates C and D, in words 19 to 24 (part of the second and third row).
Fourth participant then marks the sides as ‘DELTA’.
These plates are now completed.

Once the key ceremony is completed, it’s time to perform a full restoration of the devices and verification of the generated addresses.
This is done through a process called mnemonic validation that verifies that the process was successful and all steel plates contain correct words.
If mnemonic validation isn’t performed, there is no guarantee that you’ll be able to restore a mnemonic phrase.

## Mnemonic validation
Mnemonic validation is performed with the steel plates marked with stickers and by the same master of ceremony and the previous (or four different ones) participants.
RIDDLE&CODE’s recommendation is that the same participants perform mnemonic validation, where each participant will verify the words he wrote himself.
Next, generate a set of addresses and write them down publicly.
Repeat this process after each restoration. A restoration will be considered successful if the same set of addresses is generated.
In this process, each side of all four plates is used to restore the signature devices.
The master of ceremony is responsible for handing out the correct plates to each participant and ensuring that the same plate’s side isn’t used twice. The master of key ceremony should also ensure that none of the participants turn the plates and read the opposite side.

Each of the 4 participants are assigned with a set of words: 'ALPHA’, 'BETA', 'GAMMA', and ‘DELTA’. Altogether, the 4 plates have each set of words written twice.
The first participant ('ALPHA') privately opens the first corresponding side, inputs the words, and closes the plate.
The second (using the word 'BETA'), third (using the word ‘GAMMA’) and fourth participant (using the word ‘DELTA’') do the same.
At this point, a set of addresses has to be generated and verified against the previous one.
The same operation (recover, addresses deletion, generation and verification) will be performed again by using the set of words written on the 'other' plates’ sides (the ones which have not just been used).

After both addresses are verified, the stickers will be removed.
Finally, the master of ceremony seals the steel plates in the presence of all people involved.

## Mnemonic phrase restoration
To perform a recovery, you should take plates A and C (or B and D) and use a mnemonic phrase in this order:
The 6 words on the both sides of the plate that has the first and part of the second rows filled up, followed by,
The 6 words on the both sides that have part of the second and third rows filled up.
