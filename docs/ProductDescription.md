## Introduction
RIDDLE&CODE developed a new breed of digital asset management solution. It enables institutions, banks, family offices, traders and exchanges to buy/sell/trade cryptocurrencies and tokens and offer this service to its clients within the framework of the custodian model.  
Our solution underwent meticulous audit processes by renown international audit firms and received acceptance from Swiss regulatory bodies. Next to an innovative architecture of the core functionality of a wallet – to create and secure keys - the solution excels in providing the related business logic and policy layer to allow integration into regulated processes including full audit trails. 

## USP

In view of regular security breaches of existing digital asset management solutions, RIDDLE&CODE developed a new generation of hardware wallets with a set of innovative features and functionalities.

## Product principles 

**Your keys, your tokens**: We only develop the tools to manage and secure assets and private keys. We do not claim any kind of custody or ownership on any type of currency or token managed with our digital asset management solution.

**Algorithmic flexibility**: The solution design must allow to integrate new crypto algorithms to the hardware wallets in reliable and fast implementation cycles in order to cope with the required speed of future crypto-asset innovation.

**Peer reviews**: The complexity of cryptography related developments requires constant reviews and research. Closed systems can't deliver the necessary trustworthiness any longer. Our solution follows a strict open-source hardware and software approach and is completely transparent. Code and hardware designs are made public and are shared with our clients. 

**Code and product sovereignty**: Based on the mentioned open source and open hardware approach customers are in control of the solution. At any time, they can fork and even own our developments. There is no vendor lock-in. 

**Transient business models**: The relationship between business and customers is shifting. New business platforms have to enable customers the very same way they enable corporations. It is not possible to outfit every customer of a financial institute with a multi-thousand-dollar HSM. But it is necessary to protect customer interactions, accounts and assets with hardware wallets - without trade-offs in security and operationalizability. 

**Multi-purpose secure devices (signature devices)**: Our hardware wallets can also be used for other security-sensitive online activities. Logins with U2F, managing trust certificates on customer level, co-key-management with customers, secure self-encoding data storage for customers, etc.  are only some examples for the broad range of possible extensions. 

**Support of non-fungible, physical assets classes** : Development of our digital asset management solution not only focused on cryptocurrencies but also incorporated a design to support the emerging tokenised economy incl. the related secure tagging and chipping of physical objects. 

**Compliance** : We aim for full compliance with legal and regulatory provisions.

## Supported currencies

Through the combination of Signature Device and the Trusted Node, RIDDLE&CODE’s digital asset management solution allows for the scalability of operations while preserving the convenience of a single wallet for an institutional organization. 

RIDDLE&CODE digital asset management solution can be extended to almost any currency/token, allowing the institution’s clients to sell/buy/trade numerous cryptocurrencies or tokens without the inconvenience of managing a wallet per crypto asset, thanks to the custodian service model.

Even the most basic version of RIDDLE&CODE’s asset management solution supports the most important and relevant cryptocurrencies and tokens:

The solution currently supports 32 types of crypto assets (and derivatives thereof). Bitcoin-forked or ERC-20 assets are counted as one type. 
Additional cryptocurrencies and tokens can be implemented on request.
