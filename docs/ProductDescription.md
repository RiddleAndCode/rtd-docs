## Getting to know RIDDLE&CODE Digital Asset Custody Solution
RIDDLE&CODE developed a new breed of digital asset management solution that enables financial institutions as well as individuals to buy/sell/trade cryptocurrencies and tokens and offer this service to its clients within the framework of the custodian model.

Our solution underwent meticulous audit processes by renown international audit firms and received acceptance from Swiss regulatory bodies. Next to an innovative architecture of the core functionality of a wallet – to create and secure keys - the solution excels in providing the related business logic and policy layer to allow integration into regulated processes including full audit trails.



### Product principles

**Full control of the assets**: At RIDDLE&CODE, we believe that clients should have complete control over their assets. And Digital Asset Custody was developed with this in mind. Your keys and your tokens belong to you. We only develop the tools to manage and secure assets and private keys, without claiming any kind of ownership on any asset managed with our solution.

**Algorithmic flexibility for quick adaptation to ever-evolving market**: Keeping the pace with the thriving crypto industry, requires a solution that allows quick and easy integration of new crypto algorithms. 
Our Digital Asset Custody is powered with design new crypto algorithms to the hardware wallets in reliable and fast implementation cycles in order to cope with the required speed of future crypto-asset innovation.

**Peer reviews for code and product sovereignty**: The complexity of cryptography related developments requires constant reviews and research. Closed systems can't deliver the necessary trustworthiness any longer. Our solution follows a strict open-source hardware and software approach and is completely transparent. Code and hardware designs are made public and are shared with our clients. Thanks to this approach, customers are in control of the solution. At any time, they can fork and even own our developments. There is no vendor lock-in.

**Hardware-based security combined with software-grade convenience and flexibility**: The relationship between business and customers is shifting. New business platforms have to enable customers the very same way they enable corporations. It is not possible to outfit every customer of a financial institute with a multi-thousand-dollar HSM. But it is necessary to protect customer interactions, accounts and assets with hardware wallets - without making trade-offs in security and usability.

**Multi-purpose secure devices (signature devices)**: Our hardware wallets can also be used for other security-sensitive online activities. Logins with U2F, managing trust certificates on customer level, co-key-management with customers, secure self-encoding data storage for customers, etc.  are only some examples for the broad range of possible extensions.

**Support of non-fungible, physical assets classes**: Development of our digital asset management solution isn’t only focused on cryptocurrencies but also incorporated a design to support the tokenized economy including the related secure tagging and chipping of physical objects, enabling our clients to go beyond cryptocurrencies and participate in the thriving token economy.
