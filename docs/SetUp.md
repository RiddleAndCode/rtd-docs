The administrators perform with their devices a Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) to recreate the key to sign the communication to access the administrative pages and sign off the changes. Thereby a multi eye principle is applied to the process of changing the settings of the DAM solution.

The URL to start the process is received with the hardware (see above).
