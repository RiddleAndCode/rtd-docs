New internal coin addresses are generated by adding a new Account ID. The system then uses the AccountID to create a set of coin addresses for all supported currencies 

Hardened derivation paths are used so that the valid range for AccountIDs is defined from 0x0000 0000 to 0x7FFF FFFF.

**Please note: any AccountID must start with the # sign** 

Examples: 

* `#00112233`
