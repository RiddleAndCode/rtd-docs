4. I am using a MacBook. Do I need to install any additional applications to access and use the TMP?

Yes, you will need to install the RIDDLE&CODE Bridge Service application. The steps are as follows:
* Download the RnC Bridge 2.0.31. You can find the latest version [here](https://riddlecode.app.box.com/s/ksud48m25jytzhrhcg81hay9c378jp0y).
* Next, run "rncbridge-2.0.31.pkg". You'll see that **Security and Privacy Centre** will block the action. This means that you have to save the app as an exception to the security settings.
