# Use Cases

## Compelling use cases

Token-based business models will only flourish if the various players have indisputable identities, remain protected from malicious intrusion, dispose of transactional capabilities and adhere to regulatory frameworks.

RIDDLE&CODE Token Management Platform (TMP) provides solutions for all of these aspects and embraces the full spectrum of use cases. This section describes concrete examples, business models and applications that are enabled by the platform.


## Proof-of-origin business models

### Proving the authenticity of luxury goods
It is estimated that the global luxury market will reach €1.3 trillion (approx. $1.5 trillion) by 2025, with millennials representing 50% of the total market. However, the rapid expansion comes with the challenge of ensuring that luxury products are produced in a fair and sustainable manner for both manufacturers and consumers.

The luxury sector has waged a battle against counterfeiters for years, spending a fortune on distribution control and legal fees. According to a report by Research and Markets, fraud and identity theft have raised strong consumer distrust while luxury brands lost $30.3 billion (€27 billion) to counterfeited goods through the Internet in 2017. The main challenges within the sector remain:
* QR codes and certificates can be forged and are limited to one-way information transactions.
* RFIDs and holograms cannot eliminate theft and counterfeiting.
* Online registries expose consumers to identity theft and private data hacks.

**Solution proposed**
For this use case, the TMP can assign unique identities for high-value luxury goods and create their respective digital twins on the ledger. This allows brands to:

* Digitise, track and trace the entire lifecycle of a luxury product,
* Create an immutable record of every step in the supply chain,
* Capture specific data points and offer public access to that data.


### Proving the origin of the machine data
As a digitalised society, we empower physical objects by creating their so-called ‘digital twins’ and giving them the ability to transact with online platforms, thereby collecting massive amounts of data.

However, with the current operating systems, connected objects are never truly autonomous, and they require human assistance. In addition, digital twins are connected and communicate through a centrally controlled network, which always represents a single point of failure.

**Solution proposed**
RIDDLE&CODE’s platform provides features and functions that allow for scalability and interoperability of smart city systems. It provides a single data repository where any system and any number of new objects can plugin without the need to commit additional resources. Attesting and verifying the data source for any operational data means that we can rely on the produced data without actually owning a machine.


## Blockchain-based data notary services
Blockchain-based data notary services can solve critical issues of traceability within complex supply chains. Let’s take the metal industry as an example. The supply chain within the metal industry is highly complex, fragmented and not digitalised.

In fact, saying that the metal industry is paper-based is an understatement. Only in Europe 500 steel production sites and 500,000 metal processing companies exchange around 100 million paper certificates every year to meet regulatory requirements for material quality documentation.

While more and more machines are being connected to the Internet, these documents remain paper-based and non-machine readable. This makes product tracking and identification extremely challenging and has caused an increase in opportunities for fraud and negligence.

**Solution proposed**
In 2020, RIDDLE&CODE joined forces with S1Seven to mitigate these traditional inefficiencies by building a blockchain-based notarisation service for metal certificates that provides a product with a tamper-proof digital identity and traces each step of its journey from raw material to the final application. The service allows steel manufacturers to replace mandatory hard copy documents with digital records for smart manufacturing and assessing CO2 emissions, immutably stored on a decentralised platform.


## Fractional ownership models through tokenization

### Shares in renewable energy production
Local energy communities and microgrids are expected to play an increasingly important role in addressing climate change challenges and transitioning towards renewable and sustainable energy systems. However, the current structure of energy and electricity markets is inadequate to achieve this vision, as consumers are practically excluded and unable to participate in energy production and settlements.

**Solution proposed**
Together with Wien Energie, one of Austria’s largest utility providers, RIDDLE&CODE set out to bridge this gap and launch a blockchain-powered platform—MeiPower. The platform enables consumers to participate in both energy consumption and production and benefit from partial ownership of renewable energy sources. MeiPower tokenizes Solar Photovoltaic (PV) assets and allows consumers to purchase shares of PV plants across the country.

In return for their investments, consumers receive tokens in an amount based on the energy produced by the PV plant. The accumulated tokens can then be used to pay electricity bills or buy groceries at a supermarket.


## Reshaping the art world
The fine arts market has recently reached $63 billion and a 20% increase in auction sales worldwide. However, this conservative industry hasn’t changed its business model for decades, and only 8% of the art auctions are performed online.

Due to this fact, the art market faces several inherent problems, including a lack of transparency and digitalisation, low liquidity, high fees and copyright issues. It is estimated that billions of dollars in revenues are lost each year due to piracy, which is a massive loss for artists who often cannot prove the authenticity and ownership of their work.

**Solution proposed**
Tokenizing art pieces is an efficient way to create an immutable registry of art copyright records, provide liquidity with lower fees, increase transparency for all participants in the ecosystem and reduce onboarding costs.

And that is exactly what RIDDLE&CODE is developing in conjunction with the business innovation collective RDI Digital. The two companies are creating a blockchain-based art-patronage app for the renowned Moscow-based Tretyakov Gallery. The project will allow both individuals and smaller enterprises to make donations and become patrons of famous works of art. The collected funds will be used for the digitalisation of the gallery’s vast collection.


## Peer-to-peer energy trading
For decades, the structure of energy providers has revolved around centralised systems of generation, storage and distribution that are limited for one-way energy and value flows. This system relies on outdated and unscalable infrastructure, raises environmental concerns and does not allow small and micro-producers to participate in the production and settlements.

**Solution proposed**
Blockchain technology can solve many of the centralised grid’s issues, including unbundling networks, automating infrastructure and operations, lowering maintenance costs and creating a positive environmental impact. In addition, since blockchain was developed to operate as a distributed network of nodes that facilitates and verifies transactions, it is perfectly suitable for supporting small and micro-energy producers to generate their own energy, share surpluses through the peer-to-peer network and reduce the overall cost for communities.

In 2018, Wien Energie, one of the largest utility providers in Austria, partnered with RIDDLE&CODE to explore blockchain technology and see if it could adopt decentralised energy grids and improve its infrastructure to better suit the needs of its consumers.

RIDDLE&CODE provided a blockchain-powered energy extension that represents a Proof of Concept (PoC) solution that can be connected and fully integrated into an external device. Once it is connected, the extension establishes a tamper-proof identity for all devices related to the production and consumption of energy and turns them into trusted data sources that can read related sensor data, attest these data on the ledger and perform value transactions and settlements. In this way, each connected device is transformed into a wallet that can perform transactions.

After the extension is plugged into a PV system, it registers the production data of Viertel Zwei (district in Vienna) residents, sends it to the ledger and creates an immutable log. Consumers can then buy energy from the PV system, which is cheaper than buying energy from the grid. The more consumers use locally produced energy, the cheaper their electricity bills become, and the energy becomes greener.

To track their production and consumption performance, residents of Viertel Zwei can simply visit the relevant website and if desired, switch to a different tariff or even trade the electricity they generate among themselves.


## Converting physical assets into tokens
The tokenization of physical assets involves binding a digital token to a certain physical object, such as a car, house or art piece. Creating a digital twin for such high-value objects gives them the transactional ability and the opportunity to distribute fractional ownership among investors.

This is particularly useful in the traditional financial world, where investment barriers can be extremely high. Think about the amount of investment required to buy a real estate asset or a piece of art. For instance, up to now, to have ownership in real estate, one has been obligated to buy the entire property. The result has always been high transaction costs and limited investment opportunities.

**Solution proposed**
Tokenization, on the other hand, allows for the creation of divisible real estate property with fractional ownership functionality, reduced fees and increased transparency. Unnecessary delays related to legacy property rights registration systems could be eliminated, barriers to entry could be lowered and the friction between real estate buyers and sellers could be reduced. Small retail investors can diversify their portfolios and enter the previously exclusive markets that were only for the large investors.
