# Key ceremony

In these guides we describe the key ceremony protocol. There are different ways a key ceremony can be executed. In these documents, we give our recommendations on performing a ceremony based on experiences and requirements from the Swiss banking industry. We cover the traditional BIP-039-based backup of a mnemonic and the SLIP-039-based back up of a mnemonic.
