# Key ceremony

In this section, we describe the different ways a key ceremony can be executed.

Keys (private/public) are the foundation of each business case or application built upon blockchain. Whoever controls the keys, also owns and controls digital assets. Therefore, the key ceremony is the most critical procedure to guarantee security and control over the assets.

We give our recommendations on performing the ceremony based on requirements from the Swiss banking industry and cover the traditional BIP-039 and SLIP-039 approach for backing up the mnemonic phrase.
