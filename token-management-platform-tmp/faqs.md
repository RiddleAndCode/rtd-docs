<summary>What are AccountIDs ?</summary>

AccountIDs provide a set of coin addresses under a common identifier. New internal coin addresses are generated by adding a new AccountID. The system then uses the AccountID to create a set of coin addresses for all supported currencies.

Hardened derivation paths are used so that the valid range for AccountIDs is defined from 0x0000 0000 to 0x7FFF FFFF.

**Note:** any AccountID must start with the # sign. For example:

* `#00112233`
* `#11223344`
* `#00DDEEFF`

<summary>The Approval device can't be found and I'm using MacOs. Do I need to install any additional applications to access and use the TMP?</summary>

Yes, you will need to install the RIDDLE\&CODE Bridge Service application.

The steps are as follows:

* Download the RnC Bridge 2.0.31. You can find the latest version [here](https://riddlecode.app.box.com/s/ksud48m25jytzhrhcg81hay9c378jp0y).
* Next, run "rncbridge-2.0.31.pkg". You'll see that **Security and Privacy Centre** will block the action. This means that you have to save the app as an exception to the security settings.
