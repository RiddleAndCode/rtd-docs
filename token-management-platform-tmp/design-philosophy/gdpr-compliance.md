# GDPR compliance



Token Management Platform (TMP) is fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements. The platform leverages the concept of confidential computing that ensures privacy by design and default. Changes processed by and within the system are registered and stored in compliance with GDPR requirements.

TMP associates all generated coin addresses with client accounts through an anonymous eight-digit account ID, ensuring that no personal data is stored within the solution. All personal client data processed during onboarding is protected by the Data Protection Note and detailed in this document.

### **General Data Protection Notice**

RIDDLE\&CODE is committed to personal data protection.

RIDDLE\&CODE processes personal data in compliance with the relevant data protection regulations, in particular, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, Regulation \[EU] 2016/679) and the Austrian Data Protection Act (DSG). Any data processed by RIDDLE\&CODE will, therefore, only take place within the scope of a legal basis, which will be stated below for the individual data processing operations. All employees of RIDDLE\&CODE entrusted with data processing are obliged to maintain the confidentiality of the client’s data. No automated decision making is carried out.

### **Transmission of personal data**&#x20;

RIDDLE\&CODE transmits personal data only to the extent necessary and only in the following cases:

* with consent;
* for the processing of contractual relationships or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures;
* when legally obliged to do so;
* to companies that support RIDDLE\&CODE in providing services; these service providers act as processors, who may only process the data within the framework of a Data Processing Agreement;
* to protect a company’s legitimate interests (e.g., to assert, exercise or defend legal claims) or those of a third party.

In the cases mentioned above, the following third parties may come into consideration: contractual and business partners who are involved in the delivery or service (e.g., logistics companies), banks (for handling payment transactions), legal representatives, courts, auditors/tax consultants, administrative authorities, self-governing bodies (social insurance carriers) or insurance companies.

RIDDLE\&CODE does not transfer clients' personal data to third parties unless in specific cases where a party involved is domiciled in a third country (e.g., in the case of a client with headquarters outside the EU). If the data is transferred to a country without adequate data protection legislation, RIDDLE\&CODE ensures an adequate level of protection by using suitable guarantees in the form of appropriate contracts (standard contractual clauses) or binding internal data protection regulations (Binding Corporate Rules) or by relying on the exceptional circumstances otherwise provided for GDPR (consent, execution of a contract, establishment, exercise or enforcement of legal claims, overriding public interests, already published personal data or to protect the integrity of data subjects).

In this context, RIDDLE\&CODE would also like to point out that any data voluntarily published by the clients about the company’s services is public and potentially accessible worldwide.

### **Storing personal data**&#x20;

Unless otherwise specified in the respective processing, RIDDLE\&CODE stores personal data for as long as it is necessary to ensure the fulfilment of the aforementioned purposes or as long as we are legally obliged to do so.

The personal data of clients using Token Management Platform services are protected with segregation of accounts, which ensures that only duly authorised parties have access to the data relevant to them. This is done in a way that every individual account is protected with ID codes and mapped to coin addresses. The ID codes become part of the key derivation scheme and, therefore, part of the transaction data), creating a link between the assets and account holders. The TMP does not process or store any personal data, only the hash of the mapped account.

Personal data that clients voluntarily provide will be stored by RIDDLE\&CODE for the purpose of providing the associated processing and keeping records for up to 3 years after completion or termination, except when a longer storage period is required for the purpose of fulfilling a legal obligation or for the assertion or defence of legal claims.&#x20;



### Rights of the data subject

Provided that respective legal requirements are met, the client can assert the following rights of data subjects:

1. **Right to information:** You can request confirmation as to whether personal data concerning you is being processed and request information about this data and the information pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR.
2. **Right of rectification:** If RIDDLE\&CODE processes incorrect or incomplete data about the client (Art. 16 GDPR).
3. **Right to have personal data concerning the client deleted:** If the conditions of Art. 17 GDPR are met.
4. **Right to limit the processing of your data (Art. 18 GDPR).**
5. **Right to transfer the data provided by the client,** provided that the processing is based on consent (Art. 6 paragraph 1 letter a) or on a contract (Art. 6 paragraph 1 letter b) to which the client is party and that the processing is carried out using automated procedures (Art. 20 GDPR).
6. **Right to object to the processing of personal data**: When processing operations carried out on the basis of legitimate interests (pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 letter of GDPR), the client has the right to object to the processing of personal data pursuant to Art. 21 GDPR, provided that there are reasons for doing so arising from a particular situation. When processing for the purpose of direct marketing, this right is unrestricted.
