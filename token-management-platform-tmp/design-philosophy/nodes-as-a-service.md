# Nodes as a service

Full node service is an integrative part of the Token Management Platform (TMP) for each client that comes without extra cost. The service is developed to reduce the dependency on third-party node uptime and to provide a stable and reliable connectivity to the respective blockchain/DLT networks. Full node service is available for specific digital assets (see: [**Available currencies**](../available-currencies.md)).

### Full node hosting service

By definition, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is distributed. This distributed nature means that a stable connection to a full node of each currency is a prerequisite for seamless and swift execution and verification of a transaction against various ledgers, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

In most cases, crypto transactions are confirmed without any issues. There are some circumstances, however, that may lead a transaction to be unsuccessful and fail to execute. One reason for this can be broken connectivity to the various DLT nodes.

The connection to the DLT is usually achieved by a single node. The uptime of a single DLT full node is difficult to determine as it is unclear with what availability a single full node is hosted. This results in unstable, broken connectivity to the various DLT nodes and the inability to execute transactions.

In order to reduce the dependency on third-party node uptime, RIDDLE\&CODE built a full node hosting service for the supported currencies covered by the SLA. The service provides stable and reliable full node connectivity to the respective blockchain/DLT networks and allows the client to securely verify transactions. The downtime of the overall system is expected to be close to zero.

Required hardware and software are installed in RIDDLE\&CODEâ€™s hosting centre with the following operations and monitoring services:

* Certification according to the internationally accredited DIN/ISO IEC 27001 Norm standards.
* Continuous 24/7 monitoring of the entire infrastructure.
* SLA with various levels of support and service availability, depending on the needs of the client.
