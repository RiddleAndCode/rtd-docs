# Key and identity management



* This document describes the process of secure and confidential key generation, backup and recovery.
* RIDDLE\&CODEâ€™s Token Management Platform ensures that the entire process, from key generation to key recovery, is entirely managed by the client.
* All key management-related operations are performed within the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which provides hardware-enforced code and data-in-use isolation.
* The client is the only entity that can access the TEE and, therefore, has full ownership and control over the keys. RIDDLE\&CODE, as the solution provider, does not have access to the keys and related processes at any time.
* Keys are generated in a secure and agile way without a possibility for others to intercept or access the keys.
* The secure key recovery process can be performed in the case of disaster.
* RIDDLE\&CODE provides a detailed step-by-step guide for performing secure and trusted key generation and recovery.
